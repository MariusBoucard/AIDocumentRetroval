# Plugin usage for relevent parameter settings.

Actually, it seems we don't care about what is trully doing the parameter to the sound in first instance. We need to know which parameter we should use.

To do so, we should create a prompt template that would allow us to choose which parameter should moove inside the plugin

and then we should gather the data that will tell us how to do so ? 

# How to format the data
-> Extracting from the user document asis is not the best approach as it creates not relevent documents

Should I create some other databases ? One directly for the different parameters to toggle regarding the effect the user want to create
and another database with the different parameters data ?

By doing 2 step asking like this, we could get more relevent answers
