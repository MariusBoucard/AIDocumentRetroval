[{"id": 0, "text": "1"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Introduction\nInfinity Bass is a powerful new bass-shaping tool that processes the sub-bass and lower-end\ncomponents of your tracks. The plugin\u2019s interactive and responsive interface gives you four\ndifferent sound profiles (or \u2018Modes\u2019) to choose from that enhance your track\u2019s low-end content\nby adding depth and warmth to your subharmonics. It even generates missing low-end content\nas needed!\nOverview\nControls\nThe plugin features four \ufffd4\ufffd different bass-shaping Modes:\n\u25cf\nPunchy: Bass exciter excellent for treating basslines and kick drums\n\u25cf\nWarm: Dual-band subharmonic synthesizer that creates an octaver-style effect\n\u25cf\nDeep: Clean sub generator with dynamics control that can also treat full mixes\n\u25cf\nPhased: Bass-focused all-pass filter that helps weak bass transients pop out\nThe Amount control adjusts the strength of the overall effect.\n2"}, {"id": 2, "text": "The\nFrequency\ncontrol\ntargets\nthe\nfrequency\nrange\nthat\nwill\nbe\nused\nto\ngenerate\nsub-harmonics or influence the overall tone of the processing.\nThe Character control offers different sound flavors by modifying certain characteristics of the\nsignal depending on the selected Mode (see below for more info).\nThe Listen button isolates the processed portion of the signal so you can hear the effect the\nplugin is having on the source.\nModes\nPunchy\nThis mode is useful on basslines, kicks of full mixes that require more punch, thump, or overall\npresence. It can also be used to treat old mixes at the risk of boosting low end noise. In this\nmode, the signal below the frequency control is EQ\u2019ed, compressed, and saturated before\nbeing added back to the original signal. The Character control blends additional saturation into\nthe enhanced signal so that the bass will stick out in the mix.\nWarm\nThis mode produces an octaver-like effect with lots of harmonics. The signal within the\nfrequency band is split into two individual bands and a sub is generated from each one. The\nCharacter control then adds even more saturation to have more presence, while the Frequency\ncontrol is used to tune the range of the generator to the source material to get the best result.\nIf not tuned correctly for your track, clashing sub-harmonics may be generated, so make sure\nto adjust this parameter with care. Works best on monophonic material, like bass DIs or synths\nthat would benefit from extra subs and warm distortion.\nDeep\nThis mode functions as a clean sub generator with dynamics control. The signal within the\nfrequency band is used to generate a monophonic sub. The character controls the sub's decay\nand dynamics to dial in the shape of the generated signal. This mode is perfect for adding\nmissing low-end to kicks and basses. It can also be used on full mixes if the low mid-section is\nnot too crowded.\n\ufffdIf the generated sub conflicts with the dry signal, simply fine-tune the Frequency control.)\nPhased\nThis mode smears your bass content around, adding resonance and lowering the peak\namplitude of the source signal, which may enhance loudness. This mode only affects the signal\ncontent below the range set by the frequency control. Meant primarily as a sound design\neffect, this mode can also be useful on weak bass transients to make them stand out.\n3\n"}, {"id": 3, "text": "What the Top Bar does\nSlate Digital Logo\nOpen the About Panel with additional links to User Guide and Online\nSupport.\nShow/Hide Presets\nToggle Browser display.\nCurrent Preset\nShow the currently loaded Preset.\nSave Preset\nSave/override the currently loaded Preset.\nUndo/Redo\nCancel or restore any recent actions inside the plugin.
